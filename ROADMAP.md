### Phase 1 Achievements Summary

Built a comprehensive CLI tool (`fts5-foundation`) with advanced architecture:

- **Complete FTS5 Foundation**: Working virtual tables with unicode61 tokenizer
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete with automatic FTS5 indexing
- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Basic, category-filtered, and field-specific searches
- **BM25 Integration**: Proper scoring with negative value interpretation
- **Professional Architecture**: CommandGroup pattern, layered design, type-safe errors
- **Robust CLI Interface**: Hierarchical commands, comprehensive help, proper flag handling

### Key Learnings for Future Phases

**Architecture Patterns**:

- CommandGroup pattern scales excellently for complex CLI applications
- Type-safe error handling with DisplayError() significantly improves UX
- Layered architecture (commands/handlers/models/errors) enables clean code organization

**FTS5 Integration Insights**:

- BM25 negative scoring requires careful result interpretation
- FTS5 automatically maintains indexes during CRUD operations (no manual management needed)
- Unicode61 tokenizer with diacritics removal works well for general text processing

**Development Process Refinements**:

- Complex phases benefit from chunked development across multiple sessions
- Early architecture establishment prevents major refactoring later
- go-integration-agent proved most valuable for design reviews
