## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **FTS5 Build Issues**: Maintain docker container with known-good build environment
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Profile early and often, maintain performance regression tests
- **SQLite Version Conflicts**: Pin SQLite version, document compatibility requirements

### Learning Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase boundaries, resist adding features before mastering basics
- **Context Overload**: Regular session clearing, focused experiments over monolithic projects
- **Theoretical Drift**: Maintain hands-on focus, validate understanding through working code
