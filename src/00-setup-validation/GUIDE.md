## Conceptual Foundations

### Understanding SQLite FTS5 Integration

#### The FTS5 Module Concept

Think of FTS5 as a **specialized search engine plugin** for SQLite:

**Real-World Analogy**: Imagine SQLite as a filing cabinet system. Standard SQLite gives you organized drawers and folders (tables and indexes). FTS5 adds a sophisticated librarian who can instantly find any document containing specific words, even if they're buried deep in the files.

**Technical Reality**:
- FTS5 creates **virtual tables** that look like regular tables but are actually search indexes
- When you insert data into an FTS5 table, it automatically builds inverted indexes
- Queries use the `MATCH` operator instead of `LIKE` for search operations

#### Why FTS5 Matters for Modern Applications

**Traditional Database Search Limitations**:
```sql
-- Slow and inflexible
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE content LIKE '%search term%';
```

**FTS5 Search Advantages**:
```sql
-- Fast and sophisticated
SELECT * FROM documents_fts WHERE documents_fts MATCH 'search term';
```

**Key Benefits FTS5 Provides**:
- **Performance**: Searches are indexed, not scanned
- **Linguistic Intelligence**: Handles stemming, synonyms, and language-specific features
- **Relevance Ranking**: BM25 algorithm scores results by relevance
- **Query Flexibility**: Boolean operators, phrase matching, field-specific searches

### Understanding Go Build Tags for CGO Libraries

#### The CGO Compilation Challenge

**The Problem**: SQLite is written in C, but Go is designed for memory safety. Integrating them requires special compilation steps.

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of build tags like **recipe modifications**. The base Go recipe makes a simple program. Adding `-tags fts5` is like adding special ingredients that require extra preparation steps but unlock new capabilities.

**Technical Details**:

```bash
# Basic compilation - no FTS5 support
go run main.go                    # ❌ FTS5 unavailable

# FTS5-enabled compilation  
go run -tags fts5 main.go         # ✅ FTS5 functional
```

**Why This Happens**:
1. `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` uses build tags to conditionally include FTS5 code
2. Without the tag, FTS5-related code isn't compiled into the binary
3. Runtime attempts to use FTS5 fail with "no such module" errors

#### Build Tag Best Practices

**Development Workflow**:
```bash
# Development and testing
go run -tags fts5 ./setup-validation validation validate

# Production builds
go build -tags fts5 -o validator ./setup-validation
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Forgetting the build tag (most common beginner error)
- Using build tags inconsistently across team members
- Not documenting build requirements in project documentation

### BM25 Scoring: SQLite's Unique Approach

#### Understanding Inverted Scoring

**Traditional Search Engine Scoring**: Higher scores = better matches
```
Result 1: Score 8.5 (best match)
Result 2: Score 5.2 (good match)  
Result 3: Score 1.1 (poor match)
```

**SQLite FTS5 BM25 Scoring**: Lower (more negative) scores = better matches
```
Result 1: Score -1.5 (best match)
Result 2: Score -3.2 (good match)
Result 3: Score -8.7 (poor match)
```

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of BM25 scores like **golf scores** - lower numbers indicate better performance. A score of -1.5 beats -3.2, just like a golf score of 72 beats 85.

#### BM25 Algorithm Fundamentals

**What BM25 Measures**:
- **Term Frequency**: How often search terms appear in a document
- **Document Length**: Shorter documents with matching terms rank higher
- **Collection Statistics**: How rare terms are across the entire document set

**SQLite FTS5 BM25 Parameters** (hardcoded, non-configurable):
- **k1 = 1.2**: Controls term frequency saturation
- **b = 0.75**: Controls document length normalization

**Practical Implications**:
```sql
-- Results ordered by relevance (best first)
SELECT title, content, bm25(documents_fts) as score 
FROM documents_fts 
WHERE documents_fts MATCH 'sqlite'
ORDER BY rank;  -- or ORDER BY bm25(documents_fts)
```

### CLI Architecture Design Principles

#### The CommandGroup Pattern Concept

**Traditional CLI Problem**: As applications grow, command organization becomes messy and naming conflicts emerge.

**CommandGroup Solution**: Hierarchical organization that mirrors how users think about functionality.

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of CommandGroup like a **well-organized toolbox**:
- Main toolbox (root command)
- Compartments for different tool types (command groups)
- Individual tools in appropriate compartments (sub-commands)
- Easy to find what you need, easy to add new tools

**Architectural Benefits**:
```go
Root Command
├── Validation Group
│   ├── validate (comprehensive check)
│   ├── connect (database test)
│   ├── fts5 (FTS5 functionality)
│   ├── testdata (sample data)
│   └── bm25 (scoring test)
└── Future Groups...
```

#### Type-Safe Error Handling Philosophy

**The Validation Context Challenge**: Setup validation can fail in many different ways, and users need clear guidance for resolution.

**Solution Approach**: Categorize errors by type and provide contextual help:

```go
// Error types provide context
var (
    ErrValidation = errors.New("validation failed")
    ErrDatabase   = errors.New("database operation failed") 
    ErrConnection = errors.New("connection failed")
    ErrFTS5       = errors.New("FTS5 operation failed")
)
```

**User Experience Benefits**:
- Errors include recovery suggestions
- Verbose mode provides technical details
- Error categorization enables targeted troubleshooting

## Project Infrastructure

### Architecture Overview

The setup validation project demonstrates **production-quality Go architecture** while remaining focused on learning objectives:

```
setup-validation/
├── main.go                 # Entry point with error handling
├── commands/              # CLI command definitions
│   ├── command_group.go   # Hierarchical organization pattern
│   ├── root.go           # Global initialization and flags

└── errors/           # Error handling system
    └── errors.go     # Sentinel errors and display functions
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Global Instance Pattern

**Design Choice**: Use global instances for database and configuration rather than dependency injection.

**Educational Rationale**: 
- Simplifies learning focus on FTS5 concepts rather than Go patterns
- Matches common CLI application patterns
- Eliminates complex initialization chains

**Implementation**:
```go
// Global instances initialized once in root command
var database.Instance *Database
var config.App *Config

// Accessed directly in handlers
func (h *ValidationHandler) HandleConnect() error {
    version, err := database.Instance.GetSQLiteVersion(ctx)
    // ... rest of implementation
}
```

#### 2. Stateless Handler Pattern

**Design Choice**: Handlers have no state - they access global instances directly.

**Educational Benefits**:
- Clear separation between command handling and business logic
- Simplified testing (no complex mocking required)
- Handlers focus on FTS5 operations rather than state management

#### 3. Factory Function Command Pattern

**Design Choice**: Create commands using private factory functions with public variables for registration.

**Problem Solved**: Prevents command variable naming conflicts between files while maintaining clean registration.

```go
// Public for registration
var Validation = newValidationGroup()

// Private factory prevents naming conflicts
func newValidationGroup() *CommandGroup {
    validateCmd := &cobra.Command{...}
    // ... command setup
    return &CommandGroup{...}
}
```

### Educational Design Patterns

#### Validation Suite Model

The project introduces a **structured validation approach** that you'll see throughout the learning project:

```go
type ValidationSuite struct {
    Name        string
    Description string
    StartTime   time.Time
    EndTime     time.Time
    Duration    time.Duration
    Results     []ValidationResult
}
```

**Learning Value**: 
- Demonstrates systematic testing approaches
- Shows how to structure validation results
- Provides pattern for future phase validation

#### Error Display System

The error handling system teaches **user-friendly error presentation**:

```go
func DisplayError(err error) {
    if viper.GetBool("verbose") {
        displayVerbose(err)  // Technical details for debugging
    } else {
        displaySimple(err)   // User-friendly summary
    }
}
```

**Educational Benefits**:
- Shows importance of error message quality
- Demonstrates conditional error detail levels
- Teaches error categorization for better UX

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Build Tag Issues

#### Problem: "no such module: fts5"
**Symptoms**:
```
Database initialization error: failed to connect to database: validation failed: no such module: fts5
```

**Root Cause**: Missing `-tags fts5` in the go command.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Wrong
go run ./setup-validation validation validate

# Correct
go run -tags fts5 ./setup-validation validation validate
```

**Prevention**: Always include `-tags fts5` in development and build commands.

#### Problem: CGO_ENABLED Issues
**Symptoms**: Build errors mentioning CGO or C compiler issues.

**Root Cause**: The mattn/go-sqlite3 driver requires CGO to interface with SQLite.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure CGO is enabled: `export CGO_ENABLED=1`
2. Install a C compiler (gcc on Linux, Xcode on macOS, mingw on Windows)
3. Verify with: `go env CGO_ENABLED`

### SQLite Installation Issues

#### Problem: SQLite Version Too Old
**Symptoms**: FTS5 features not available even with build tags.

**Detection**:
```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

**Requirements**: SQLite 3.20.0 or newer for full FTS5 support.

**Solutions**:
- **Linux**: Update via package manager (`apt update sqlite3`)
- **macOS**: Update via Homebrew (`brew upgrade sqlite`)
- **Windows**: Download latest from sqlite.org

#### Problem: FTS5 Not Compiled in SQLite
**Symptoms**: "no such module: fts5" even with correct build tags.

**Detection**:
```bash
sqlite3
> PRAGMA compile_options;
```
Look for `ENABLE_FTS5` in the output.

**Solutions**:
1. Install SQLite with FTS5 support
2. Use a different SQLite distribution
3. Compile SQLite from source with FTS5 enabled

### Development Environment Issues

#### Problem: Module Path Errors
**Symptoms**: Import path errors when running commands.

**Root Cause**: Running commands from wrong directory or incorrect module setup.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're in the `/home/jaime/research/go-sqlite/src/00-setup-validation/` directory
2. Verify `go.mod` exists and has correct module name
3. Run `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies

#### Problem: Permission Errors
**Symptoms**: Cannot create database files or access directories.

**Solutions**:
1. Check directory permissions
2. Run from a directory with write access
3. Use in-memory databases (`:memory:`) for testing

### Performance Issues

#### Problem: Slow Validation
**Symptoms**: Validation takes much longer than expected.

**Debugging**:
```bash
go run -tags fts5 ./setup-validation validation validate --verbose
```

**Common Causes**:
1. Slow disk I/O
2. Large sample datasets
3. Debug builds vs optimized builds

**Solutions**:
1. Use in-memory databases for validation
2. Reduce sample data size
3. Build with optimization: `go build -tags fts5 -ldflags "-s -w"`

### Output Issues

#### Problem: Missing Output or Formatting
**Symptoms**: Expected output doesn't appear or is malformed.

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check if output is going to stderr vs stdout
2. Try different output formats: `--format json`
3. Enable verbose mode: `--verbose`

**Solutions**:
1. Redirect stderr: `command 2>&1`
2. Use explicit format flags
3. Check terminal encoding settings
